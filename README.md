This repository contains the code and report for the course Data Systems Project held at the Universiteit van Amsterdam (UvA) in 2021-2022. 

This project was completed in collaboration with the Dutch Police Academy and the Dutch Institute of Applied Scientific research (TNO).

The goal of this project was to provide the police academy with a tool that could extract patterns in unstructured court verdicts that were made publicly available through rechtspraak.nl.
